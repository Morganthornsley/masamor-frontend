            <p>Let's be honest.</p>
            <p>You've tried journaling. You've tried therapy. You've tried meditation apps and self-help books.</p>
            <p>And you're still waking up anxious. Still second-guessing yourself. Still feeling like you're performing your own life.</p>
            <p><strong>Because insight without integration changes nothing.</strong></p>
            <p>This retreat isn't about learning more. It's about becoming different.</p>
            <p>You're not escaping your life. You're building a new operating system for it.</p>

            <p>For nine years, I was on anti-depressants. Not because I was broken—because my nervous system was stuck in survival mode.</p>
            <p>The moment I learned to rewire my nervous system through movement, therapeutic work, and authentic connection—everything changed.</p>
            <p>Not just how I felt. But who I was capable of becoming.</p>
            <p><strong>That's what this retreat does.</strong></p>
            <p>It gives your body permission to release what it's been holding. It gives your mind new neural pathways to walk. It gives your soul space to remember who you really are.</p>
